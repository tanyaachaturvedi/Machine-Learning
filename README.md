# Machine Learning Practice

This repository contains a collection of my practice notebooks and projects as I explore and learn machine learning concepts.

## Notebooks

### 1. Linear and Logistic Regression
* **File:** `Linear_and_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`
* **Description:** A comprehensive notebook implementing and evaluating fundamental regression and classification models from scikit-learn.
* **Topics Covered:**
    * **Data Loading:** Manually loading the Boston Housing dataset and loading the built-in Breast Cancer dataset.
    * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using pandas `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.
    * **Linear Regression:**
        * Simple `LinearRegression` with cross-validation.
        * Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization) with `GridSearchCV` to find the best alpha.
        * Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization) with `GridSearchCV` to find the best alpha.
    * **Logistic Regression:**
        * Implementing `LogisticRegression` for a binary classification problem.
        * Hyperparameter tuning for `C` and `max_iter` using `GridSearchCV`.
    * **Model Evaluation:**
        * **Regression Metrics:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared ($R^2$).
        * **Classification Metrics:** Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, and a detailed Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
